    h2 About Event Planner
    p This website was created in 2025 as a student project by Adil Surve.
    p Over time, it has grown in popularity and is now used by people to discover weather-based event recommendations across the globe.
    p The app uses the Weatherbit API to fetch weather data and Ticketmaster to find local events.
    p Whether it’s hot, cold, or rainy — the planner suggests the best indoor or outdoor events based on your city and preferences.
    p Users love the convenience of getting weather-smart recommendations in just one click.
    p The project continues to evolve with more features, better search options, and even international support.
